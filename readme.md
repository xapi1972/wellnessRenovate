# Project Name  : WellnessRenovate

## Description

this project has the objective that people who have an apartment to reform, initially in the cities of Barcelona and Madrid, can consult what is the cost of their reform and get metrics on sales prices and rent prices/m2 of the area, being able to select the witnesses to get those metrics, and have direct links to the main real state web portals (Fotocasa & Idealista).

## User Stories

-  **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault
-  **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the platform so that I can start searching for budgets, or just checking for sale/rent prices in any address.
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform.
-  **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform.
-  **Generate & Save Report** As a user, and giving the address of my apartment, I can request and download at the moment a budget about the cost of the reform of my flat, and get an estimated price I would be able to sell it once reformed. I will get addionational information:

	- More metrics of the area/neighbourhood : rent price/m2, sell price/m2 of unreformed apartments, sell price/m2 of new construccion building, ...
	- List with detail characteristics of the witnesses used to calculate the metrics. The use will see this witnesses remarked on the map. The user would be able to change the witnesses used to estimated the sell rate, changing for other that appears on the map, and considered more suitable.
-  **Search for Metrics in any area** As a user I want to check metrics values of selling/rental prices in any address of these cities.
-  **See my Reports/Budgets** As a user I want to see my budgets

## MVP

- Create React-Route landing page. Short description of the service, the user will be able to login/logout, signup, or click a button for an online demo (the report will be shown only for few seconds, since we want the user to sign-up).

- Create React-Route where the user chooses the type of reform to an apartment: PARCIAL OR TOTAL. If it's parcial, a short questionary will be shown, asking the user to set the % of reform it needs: bathrooms, kitchen, floors, electrical installation, water installation, walls,.... This will be done with progress bars, from 0 to 100%. Once the information is in, the user will be prompted with a Form component to enter the address.

- Create React-Route Witnesses: the user will receive the list of witnesses, viewing in a list and in a map. The user will be able to change the witnesses (select different ones to calculate the metrics), and apply filters to stretch the search: nÂº of rooms, bathrooms, etc...
Each marker on the map will have a pop-up with the information regarding the flat. At the end, will be able to generate the report.

- Create React-Route Report: Report with detailed information and graphics.

- Login/logout/Sign-up
